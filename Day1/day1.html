                Although, she is a television character, she has been a big inspiration for me in my journey in the tech world. Felicity inspired me to become interested in technology. I have always love creating things from when i was little. Watching Arrow and felicity on the series enlightened me about the possibilities technology open, i could bring my creations to life and channel my creativity and imaginations through technology and create things that will have impact on me, people around me and the world at the large. The possibilities were amazing and awesome to learn about.

                In season four of Arrow, an Implantable bio-stimulant chip was developed by Felicity's company partner, Curtis. It enabled her walk after she became paralzed due to her accident. That technological achievement was really amazing and enlightening because it made me see a bigger picture where i could create software that will adversely help people in their life and alleviate suffering.

                Felicity smoak developed many things in a her life. When she was only seven years old, Felicity built her first supercomputer. She was able to fix a defibrillator machine and ensure a Palmer Tech elevator stopped at the boardroom by adjusting their wiring. She also revamped the Arrowcave and designed a custom-made bow for Oliver in his new crusade. She helped Ray in building his A.T.O.M. Exosuit, such as determining that he needed a quantum processor to power its beams, something even Ray had trouble figuring out. Working together, Felicity and Curtis designed the Green Monster crossbow and an implant to cure John Diggle's arm tremors. She even upgraded the Canary Day1Cry into the sonic bracelet amongst many other things.

                I love Felicity Smoak personality, i really admire her very much and aspire to be like her and even exceed her capabilities. I am grateful to the creators of Felicity Smoak, for creating such a beautiful, strong-willed, and genuis character.
